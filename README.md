# Analysis of Heart Disease Causes   

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
 

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Analytics
  * Unsupervised Learning
  * Supervised Learning

### Technologies
* Python 
  * Pandas
  * Sklearn
  * Matplotlib
  * SciPy

## Project Description
* Data set was obtained from [Heart Disease UCI Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
* Scatterplots and barplots were created in order to understand the distributions and relationships between variables
* Agglomerative clustering was done on the data and each cluster was analyzed
* A dendrogram was also created to visualize the clusters
* Naive Bayes Classification and Decision Tree Classification were both used and compared in order to determine which model was the most accurate
